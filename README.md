# Book Collection System
Book Collection System

In this homework, a book collection system is implemented. A book collection has a list of genres (e.g.,
science fiction). Each genre is denoted with a unique name and a list of books under that genre. Each book is
identified by a unique name and a list of authors. The implementation is done using LINKED-LISTS.
